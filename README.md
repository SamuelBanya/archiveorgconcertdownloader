# archiveorgconcertdownloader
Hate having to search through tons of unnecessary bands just to get a few concerts from Archive.org on your device? Me too! Enter: this Python based project that allows the user to quickly grab full concert rips of given bands. Made with 'The Internet Archive Python Library', 'Requests' library, 'BeautifulSoup', and 'Django'.
